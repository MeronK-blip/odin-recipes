    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sweet Potato Pie is a dessert made with boiled whole sweet potatoes mashed and mixed with butter, sugar, 
        milk, eggs, and warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. The smooth custard filling is 
        poured into an unbaked pie crust and baked until set, developing a slightly puffed top that settles as 
        it cools. This pie offers a moist and subtly spiced flavor, with the natural sweetness of the sweet 
        potatoes enhanced by the creamy texture of the filling.</p>
