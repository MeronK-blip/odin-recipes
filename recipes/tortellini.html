    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Cheese Tortellini is a simple pasta dish made with tender cheese-filled 
        tortellini and pieces of cooked, seasoned chicken. The dish is combined with a cream, tomato sauce, garlic, \
        and herbs, allowing the ingredients to blend together without overpowering their individual flavors. 
        Itâ€™s straightforward to prepare and works well as a balanced, filling main course.</p>

        <li>2 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1 inch thickness</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divide</li>
        <li>3/4 cup drained julienne-cut sundried tomatoes in oil with herbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped shallot</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lower-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pre-grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>torn fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with salted water and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped bacon; cook, stirring occasionally, until rendered and crispy, about 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving about 3 tablespoons drippings in skillet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to skillet with drippings; cook over medium-high, until chicken is browned and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a plate to cool and then chop chicken into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and add sundried tomatoes and shallot; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until deepened in color, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in chicken broth; cook, stirring and scraping constantly to deglaze the skillet, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream and bring to a simmer over medium; simmer stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tortellini to boiling water, and boil until tortellini are tender and float to the surface, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1 cup cooking water. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir Parmesan cheese, reserved cooked bacon, reserved chopped chicken, and tortellini into skillet with cream mixture; cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until evenly coated in sauce.</li>
        <li>Add reserved cooking water, 1/4 cup at a time, if necessary to maintain a creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Put mixture into a bowl; garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and a generous scattering of fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
