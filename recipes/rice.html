    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Persian Rice is a traditional dish made with basmati rice cooked to fluffy perfection and layered over a 
        bed of thinly sliced potatoes seasoned with cumin and salt. The rice is steamed with butter, saffron, 
        and olive oil, creating distinct, aromatic grains topped with a golden crust of tender, crispy potatoes. 
        The saffron-infused rice is gently mixed and served beautifully with the potatoes lining the edges, 
        offering a combination of fluffy texture, subtle spice, and a mild buttery flavor.</p>
